•Do I have to install it?
Short answer, no.
But I also recommend you to put it in your Program folder and make a shortcut for the aseprite.exe.

•How do I run it?
You just double click on "aseprite.exe".

•It doesn't work/there are bugs/gives me errors
Welp, i'm sorry to ruin it for you, but i'm not gonna help you in this. I'm not trying to be mean, it's just that the developer needs food too!
Of course, if the Compressed file is corrupted, just let me know and i'll fix it.
If you have any kind of other problems, you can just BUY it on official sources (Check out "Where can I buy it" below) and ask to the developer for help if the problem persist.

•How can I update it?
You got a few options there.
RECOMMENDED: By buying it. It gives auto-updates if you buy it on Steam or on itch.io app (Link: http://www.aseprite.org/faq/#how-do-i-update-my-current-version)
The second one is to wait while i build it and share it. You just have to regularly check out my Dropbox (Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yv8rq13652hi22h/AACP8IwruIRsRCxbGeJ16cTaa?dl=0)
The third one is to build it yourself. (Link: https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

•Where can I buy it?
Steam (Auto updates and Beta!): http://store.steampowered.com/app/431730
Itch.io (Auto updates): https://dacap.itch.io/aseprite
Website (Few options): http://www.aseprite.org/download/

•Can I donate to the Developer?
YES you can!

•Can I donate to you random guy?
NO, you can't!
I'm not doing anything special, anyone can do what I'm doing.
I'm just doing it because I like helping people if I can.
Support the Developer!
If you want to show me your support, a nice comment will do just fine!

•Where's the v1.2-beta1
Well, there isn't any v1.2-beta1 yet.
It's only on the Steam beta branch.

•Are you the Developer?
No, I'm not.
I'm just a guy that is building it for everyone to use it.

•Is it legal?
Of course it is.
The Developer itself put it on Github for everyone to compile and use.

•What's Allegro?
It's a deprecated back-end that will be removed, that's why I built only the 1.1.5.6 on it.
Usually it gives an annoying bug while dragging windows around.
All the versions that do not have the "Allegro" word on it, are built on Skia, like they should be!

•What are these files?
So, the folder "data" and "aseprite.exe" are the main files for Aseprite.
msvcp140.dll and vcruntime140.dll are a part of Microsoft Visual C++.
They're not needed for everyone, just for who doesn't have them installed or if it says that they're missing.
I just put them in there to solve the problem instantly for some users.
You can try and delete them if you're sure that you already have Microsoft Visual C++ installed or
if you want to install it. (Download Link: https://www.microsoft.com/it-it/download/details.aspx?id=48145)
